Analysis of Temporal Factors and Surgical Outcomes.

Introduction
This study examines the impact of temporal factors on 30-day mortality and surgical complications associated with elective general surgery. Factors analyzed include the time of day, day of the week, season, and moon phase. Understanding these influences can guide surgical scheduling to improve patient outcomes.

Research Questions.
How does the time of day affect in-hospital complications?
What is the effect of the day of the week on complications?
How does the season influence complications?
Is there an effect of the moon phase on complications?

Dataset Overview.
Source: "Operation Timing and 30-Day Mortality After Elective General Surgery" (Sessler et al., 2011).
Study Population: 32,001 patients (Cleveland Clinic, Jan 2005–Sep 2010).
Variables:
Predictors: Hour (6 AM–7 PM), day of the week, season (categorized from months), moon phase.
Outcome: Complication (binary: 1 = Yes, 0 = No).
Adjustments: Gender, age, and race.
Dataset is clean with no missing data or outliers.

Methods.
Analysis: Logistic regression for binary outcomes.
Key Adjustments: Controlled for demographic confounders.
Categorization:
Season: Winter (ref.), Spring, Summer, Fall.
Moon Phase: New moon (ref.), first quarter, full moon, last quarter.
Goodness-of-fit: Hosmer-Lemeshow tests confirmed fit for most models.
Software: SAS Studio, Release 3.81.

Results.
Time of Day:
Odds of complications increased by 2.2% per hour later in the day (OR: 1.022, p = 0.001).
Day of the Week:
Higher complications on Wednesdays (+16.5%, p = 0.0027).
Lower complications on Tuesdays (-12.7%, p = 0.0088).
No significant differences for Thursday or Friday compared to Monday.
Season:
No significant differences in complications across seasons.
Moon Phase:
No significant effect of moon phase on complications.

Key Takeaways.
Significant Findings: Time of day and day of the week influence complication rates.
Non-Significant Factors: Season and moon phase showed no significant effects.
Demographics: Gender and age significantly influenced outcomes; race did not.
Conclusion
Surgeries performed later in the day and on Wednesdays are associated with higher complication risks, while temporal factors like seasons and moon phases have negligible effects. These insights can inform surgical scheduling to optimize patient outcomes. Future research should explore underlying mechanisms and refine predictive models.
